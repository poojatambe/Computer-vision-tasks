**Image Inpainting**

Image inpainting is a computer vision algorithm used to fill regions inside an image or video. The region to be filled is identified by a binary mask and neighboring pixels are used to fill the region.

The OpenCV provides image inpainting functionality with cv2.inpaint. It supports 2 algorithms.
1. Fast Marching Method
2. Navier-Stokes
